  <!-- Text Introduction Section -->
  <article class="article">
    <p>
      The Four Great Wonders of Mount Tai refer to four unique natural landscapes in the Mount Tai scenic area of
      Tai'an, Shandong Province. They mainly include the sunrise over Mount Tai, the Sea of Clouds, the Sunset Glow, and
      the Yellow River Golden Belt. Another view replaces the Yellow River Golden Belt with the Buddha's Light of Mount
      Tai. These are the core landscapes of Mount Tai, a World Cultural and Natural Heritage site.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sunrise over Mount Tai appears at dawn on the summit, as the first light gradually turns golden and the red
      sun bursts forth. The Sea of Clouds is mostly seen after summer and autumn rains, when clouds and mist surge like
      waves. The Sunset Glow appears after rain when the sky clears, with golden light piercing the clouds and shining
      on the layered peaks. The Yellow River Golden Belt is a mirage of the Yellow River seen at dusk on clear days,
      shaped like a shining golden ribbon. The Buddha's Light of Mount Tai is a colored halo formed by light diffraction
      in half-sunny, half-foggy weather and is most often seen from June to August in the area from Zhanlu Terrace to
      Nantianmen.
    </p>

    <p>
      The formation of these wonders is closely related to terrain and climate. The best time to view them is in autumn
      or after rain, with the summit and the northwestern lookout points as the core observation areas. Writers of many
      dynasties have recorded these scenes in poetry and prose, blending natural wonders with rich cultural heritage.
    </p>

    <h3>Sea of Clouds</h3>
    <p>
      The sunrise over Mount Tai is spectacular and heart-stirring, one of the wonders of the summit and an important
      symbol of Mount Tai, known as the “First Mountain under Heaven”. As the first ray of the rising sun tears through
      the darkness before dawn, the eastern sky changes from pitch black to pale grey, then red, and finally dazzling
      gold, shooting out countless beams of light. At last a fiery sun leaps above the horizon and rises into the sky.
      The whole process is like a master magician creating countless vivid scenes in moments, leaving people in awe.
      Watching the sunrise from the summit has always been a dream for visitors and has inspired many poets and writers.
    </p>

    <h3>Sunset Glow</h3>
    <p>
      When the rain has passed and the sky clears, the air is high and fresh. As the sun sets in the west, if you stroll
      on the very top of Mount Tai and look toward the western sky, the remaining clouds pile up like peaks and ridges,
      and bands of golden light cut through the clouds and mist and pour down to the earth. In the glow of the setting
      sun, every cloud peak is edged with a layer of bright gold, sparkling like precious jewels. “Who holds a colored
      brush to paint the sky, some places deep yellow, some places red.” “Clear springs fall from great heights, the
      setting sun rides over thousands of peaks.”
    </p>

    <h3>Buddha's Light of Mount Tai</h3>
    <p>
      The Buddha's Light of Mount Tai is one of the wonders of the summit. On misty mornings or evenings, if visitors
      stand on a high peak with the light behind them, they may see on the veil of fog a colored halo, blue inside and
      red outside, enclosing their entire shadow or head, like the multicolored halo above a Buddha's head, hence the
      name “Buddha's Light” or “Precious Light”. The Buddha's Light of Mount Tai is a diffraction phenomenon of light
      and appears only under certain conditions. Records state that it mostly appears from June to August in half-sunny,
      half-foggy weather when the sun shines at a slant.
    </p>

    <h3>Sea of Clouds</h3>
    <p>
      The Sea of Clouds is another wonder of the summit. In summer, after rain when the sky has just cleared, a large
      amount of water vapor rises, and when the warm, moist air from the sea is held by a high-pressure system at about
      1,500 meters above sea level, if there is no wind, you can see from the summit a vast blanket of white clouds
      stretching for miles, like a huge jade plate hanging between heaven and earth. The distant mountains are swallowed
      by the clouds and mist, with only a few peaks protruding above; nearby, visitors seem to be walking on clouds as
      if they have entered another world. When a breeze blows, waves roll across the Sea of Clouds and peaks appear and
      disappear like elusive fairy islands. When the wind grows stronger, the jade plate turns into a giant dragon,
      surging up and down like overturning seas and rivers.
    </p>

    Yellow River Golden Belt — When the sky has just cleared after rain and the setting sun is sinking, if you look far
    into the distance toward the northwest of Mount Tai, at the end of the layers of peaks you can see the Yellow River
    shining like a golden ribbon, or the river may be reflected in the sky as a mirage, both called the “Yellow River
    Golden Belt”. Its surface glitters with ripples, flashing silver light, interweaving yellow and white like a road
    paved with gold and silver, stretching from the southwest to the northeast all the way to the horizon. The Qing
    dynasty poet Yuan Mei vividly described the Yellow River Golden Belt in his “Poem on Climbing Mount Tai”: “A strip
    of yellow water like a girdle pierces through the world to reach the Milky Way.” The magical scenes of the Sunset
    Glow and the Yellow River Golden Belt are closely related to season and weather. To fully appreciate and enjoy these
    wonders, one must choose the right time to visit Mount Tai. Autumn is considered the best, when the weather is mild,
    the sky is high and the clouds are light. Next best is after a heavy rain, when remnant clouds linger, the sky is
    clear and the air is clean, the mountains and waters appear especially bright, and you can freely gaze in all
    directions and take in the splendid beauty of the land.
